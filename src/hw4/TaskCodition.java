    /* 1. Write a program to print the days of the week based on the user digit 1-7 input.

3. Write a Java program to calculate the revenue from a sale
 based on the unit price and quantity of a product input by the user.

  and 120 units, and 20% for the quantity purchased greater than 120 units.
   If the quantity purchased is less than 100 units, the discount rate is 0%.
    See the example output as shown below:

     the program should advise Bulgaria as a destination, otherwise Outside Bulgaria.
      If the budget per day for Mountain type vacation is smaller than 30 then the program
       should advise Bulgaria as a destination, otherwise Outside Bulgaria.

4. Find the largest number from a given array and print it in a console. Hint: use for loop

6. Given a list iterate it and display numbers which are divisible by 5 and if you find number
 greater than 150 stop the loop iteration list1 = [12, 15, 32, 42, 55, 75, 122, 132, 150, 180, 200]
